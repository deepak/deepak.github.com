- create project using classic html5-boilerplate. 
  using html5 shiv and not modernizer
- knew about running a local webserver using python
  ie. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  it asks for port permission, "allow to access incoming network requests"
  can do the same with ruby by
  ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080
  did not ask for port permission now. because i use ruby for
  day-to-day work and had given this permission before
- create favicon. took normal favicon 
  from http://www.xiconeditor.com/ (sized 64 x 64)
  and the apple icon 
  from http://makeappicon.com/ (named AppIcon.appiconset/Icon-76@2x and sized 152 x 152)
- cannot see changed favicon. unless i change port
  how long does chrome cache the favicon ?
